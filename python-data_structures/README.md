**Description:**

This project focuses on learning about data structures, specifically lists and tuples in Python.

**Resources:**

* Learn to Program 6 : Lists
	+ This resource provides a comprehensive introduction to lists in Python.
* Quiz:
	+ Complete the quiz to test your understanding of the concepts covered in this project.

**Learning Objectives:**

At the end of this project, you will be able to:

1. Print a list of integers
2. Secure access to an element in a list
3. Replace element
4. Print a list of integers... in reverse!
5. Can you C me now?
6. Lists of lists = Matrix
7. Tuples addition
8. More returns!
9. Find the max
10. Only by 2
11. Delete at
12. Switch

**Tasks:**

1. **Print a list of integers**
	+ Write a function called `print_list_integer` that takes a list of integers as input and prints each integer on a new line.
2. **Secure access to an element in a list**
	+ Create a function called `secure_access` that takes a list and an index as input, and returns the value at that index if it exists, or None otherwise.
3. **Replace element**
	+ Write a function called `replace_element` that takes a list and two indices as input, and replaces the element at the second index with the one from the first index.
4. **Print a list of integers... in reverse!**
	+ Create a function called `print_list_integer_reverse` that takes a list of integers as input and prints each integer on a new line, in reverse order.
5. **Can you C me now?**
	+ Write a function called `count_chars` that takes a string as input and returns the count of characters 'C' in the string.
6. **Lists of lists = Matrix**
	+ Create a function called `print_matrix_integer` that takes a list of lists of integers as input and prints each element on a new line, separated by spaces.
7. **Tuples addition**
	+ Write a function called `add_tuple` that takes two tuples as input and returns their sum, where the sum is calculated by adding corresponding elements together.
8. **More returns!**
	+ Create a function called `multiple_returns` that takes a string as input and returns a tuple containing the length of the string and its first character.
9. **Find the max**
	+ Write a function called `max_integer` that takes a list of integers as input and returns the maximum value in the list.
10. **Only by 2**
	+ Create a function called `divisible_by_2` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with True or False, depending on whether each integer is divisible by 2.
11. **Delete at**
	+ Write a function called `delete_at` that takes a list and an index as input, and removes the element at that index if it exists.
12. **Switch**
	+ Create a function called `switch_values` that takes two variables `a` and `b` as input and switches their values.
