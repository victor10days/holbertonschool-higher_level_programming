# Python - import & modules

## Description
This project is part of the **[C#27] Foundations v2.1 - Part 2** curriculum at Holberton School.  
It introduces the concept of **Python modules**, **imports**, and how to work with them effectively.  
By the end of this project, you will be able to create and use your own modules, use built-in functions like `dir()`, prevent code from executing when imported, and handle command-line arguments.
