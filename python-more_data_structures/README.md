## Description

This project covers advanced Python data structures and functional programming concepts including:
- Sets and their operations
- Dictionaries and their methods
- Lambda functions
- Map, reduce, and filter functions

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:
- Why Python programming is awesome
- What are sets and how to use them
- What are the most common methods of set and how to use them
- When to use sets versus lists
- How to iterate into a set
- What are dictionaries and how to use them
- When to use dictionaries versus lists or sets
- What is a key in a dictionary
- How to iterate over a dictionary
- What is a lambda function
- What are the map, reduce and filter functions

## Requirements

- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- All files must be executable
